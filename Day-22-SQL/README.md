## SQL Set Operations: UNION ALL, UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

This README.md file provides an overview of set operations in SQL, which are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements based on specific criteria.

### Understanding Sets

In SQL, sets are collections of unique values retrieved from a table or query. Set operations manipulate these sets to produce new result sets.

### Set Operations

Here are the four primary set operations in SQL:

1. **UNION ALL:**
   - Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements without removing duplicates.
   - All rows from each query are included in the final result set, even if they appear multiple times.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customers;
   UNION ALL
   SELECT * FROM Orders;
   ```

   This query will return all rows from the `Customers` table, followed by all rows from the `Orders` table, regardless of duplicates.

2. **UNION:**
   - Similar to UNION ALL, but removes duplicate rows from the combined result set.
   - Only unique rows are included in the final output.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customers;
   UNION
   SELECT * FROM Orders;
   ```

   This query will return all rows that exist in either the `Customers` or `Orders` table (or both), excluding duplicates.

3. **INTERSECT:**
   - Returns rows that are present in both the result sets of the two SELECT statements.
   - The common elements (intersection) are included in the final output.

   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers;
   INTERSECT
   SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders;
   ```

   This query will return customer IDs that appear in both the `Customers` and `Orders` tables, indicating customers who have placed orders.

4. **EXCEPT (MINUS):**  (Some database systems use EXCEPT, others use MINUS)
   - Returns rows that are present in the first SELECT statement but not in the second.
   - The difference between the sets is included in the final output.

   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers;
   EXCEPT
   SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders;
   ```

   This query will return customer IDs that exist in the `Customers` table but not in the `Orders` table, potentially indicating potential customers who haven't made a purchase yet.

**Important Notes:**

- The order of the SELECT statements in set operations can affect the results, especially when using UNION without ALL.
- Ensure the columns being combined in set operations have compatible data types.
- Consider using `DISTINCT` within a SELECT statement if you only need unique rows from a single table.

I hope this README.md file provides a clear explanation of SQL set operations!
