**Title:** SQL Logical Operators: Mastering Conditions and Complex Queries

**Introduction:**

Welcome! This repository delves into the world of SQL logical operators, empowering you to craft precise and efficient queries. Logical operators enable you to combine multiple conditions, unlocking the full potential of filtering and retrieving data based on specific criteria.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Logical Operators:** These operators combine Boolean expressions (conditions that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE) to control which rows are retrieved in your query.
* **Types of Logical Operators:**
    * **AND:** Returns TRUE only if all specified conditions are TRUE.
    * **OR:** Returns TRUE if any of the conditions is TRUE.
    * **NOT:** Inverts the truth value of a condition.
* **Precedence:** Logical operators follow a specific order of operations (precedence) when evaluated. Use parentheses to control the order and avoid ambiguity.
* **Comparison Operators:** These operators (e.g., `=`, `>`, `<`, `<>`) compare values and return TRUE or FALSE. They are often used within logical expressions.

**Examples:**

**Simple Examples:**

```sql
-- Select customers from California who have placed orders worth more than $100.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE state = 'CA' AND order_total > 100;

-- Select products that are either out of stock or have a price less than $5.
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE stock_level = 0 OR price < 5;

-- Select orders that are not yet shipped (NOT shipped).
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE NOT shipped;
```

**Complex Examples:**

1. **Filtering products based on multiple price ranges and categories:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE (price BETWEEN 20 AND 50 OR price > 100)
  AND category IN ('Electronics', 'Furniture');
```

2. **Finding orders placed between specific dates and excluding cancelled orders:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-02-01' AND order_date <= '2024-02-29'
  AND NOT status = 'Cancelled';
```

3. **Identifying customers who have not placed any orders in the last year:**

```sql
-- Create a subquery to find the maximum order date for each customer.
SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Use the subquery to find customers without orders in the last year.
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
  -- Subquery from above
  SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
) lo ON c.customer_id = lo.customer_id
WHERE lo.last_order_date IS NULL
  OR lo.last_order_date < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
```

**Explanation of Complex Examples:**

* **Example 1:** Uses parentheses to group conditions related to price ranges and the `IN` operator to filter by category.
* **Example 2:** Combines date range filtering with the `NOT` operator to exclude cancelled orders.
* **Example 3:** Employs a subquery to find the latest order date for each customer, then joins it with the `customers` table and filters based on the absence of orders within the last year.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Whitespace:** While not strictly required, using consistent whitespace improves readability.
* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms in your production code to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
* **Optimization:** Consider query optimization techniques for large datasets to improve performance.

**Conclusion:**

By mastering SQL logical operators, you can construct intricate queries, efficiently retrieve and analyze data, and gain valuable insights from your database. Feel free to explore further and experiment with various combinations of operators and conditions to refine your SQL skills.
