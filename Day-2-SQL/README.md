**# SQL Foundations: Delving Deeper into Operators, NULL Handling, and Order**

This guide delves into essential aspects of SQL, extending your data manipulation prowess:

* **Operator Precedence:** Understanding the order in which operations are evaluated within expressions.
* **Arithmetic Calculations with NULL Values:** Exploring how SQL handles calculations involving `NULL`.
* **DISTINCT vs. UNIQUE:** Grasping the nuances of eliminating duplicates in queries.
* **ORDER BY:** Mastering the art of sorting data based on specified columns.

## 1. Operator Precedence

Operator precedence dictates the order of operations within expressions. Just like in mathematics, some operations take precedence over others. Knowing the hierarchy is crucial for writing accurate and efficient SQL queries.

**Common Precedence Order:**

1. `*`, `/` (Multiplication and Division)
2. `+`, `-` (Addition and Subtraction)
3. Comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
4. Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT product_id, quantity * price AS total_cost
FROM orders
WHERE quantity > 5 AND total_cost / 2 < 100;
```

In this query, `quantity * price` is calculated first (multiplication), followed by the `AND` operation, and then the division (`total_cost / 2`) is performed within the `WHERE` clause.

## 2. Arithmetic Calculations with NULL Values

SQL follows specific rules when performing arithmetic operations involving `NULL` values. Understanding these rules is essential to avoid unexpected results:

* `NULL + value`: Always results in `NULL`.
* `value - NULL`: Usually results in `NULL`, but the behavior can vary depending on the database implementation.
* `value * NULL`: Always results in `NULL`.
* `value / NULL`: Always results in `NULL`.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT product_id, quantity * price AS total_cost
FROM orders
WHERE quantity IS NOT NULL;  -- Filter out rows with NULL quantities
```

This query avoids potential `NULL` issues by filtering out rows with `NULL` quantities before performing the multiplication.

## 3. DISTINCT vs. UNIQUE

Both `DISTINCT` and `UNIQUE` keywords help eliminate duplicate rows in query results, but they serve different purposes:

* **DISTINCT:** Removes duplicate rows based on the specified columns within the `SELECT` clause.
* **UNIQUE:** Enforces a constraint on a table column or set of columns, ensuring that no duplicate values exist.

**Example (DISTINCT):**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM customers;
```

This query returns a list of unique cities where customers reside.

**Example (UNIQUE):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);
```

This table definition creates a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `product_name` column, preventing duplicate product names from being inserted.

## 4. ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to sort the results of your query based on one or more columns. You can specify ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order for each column.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

This query retrieves customer names in alphabetical order (ascending).

**Combining Topics:**

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name, quantity * price AS total_cost
FROM orders
WHERE quantity IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

This query demonstrates combining the principles discussed above:

* Filters out `NULL` quantities (arithmetic handling).
* Calculates `total_cost` (operator precedence).
* Orders the results by `total_cost` in descending order (`ORDER BY`).

Remember that operator precedence, `NULL` handling, `DISTINCT`, `UNIQUE`, and `ORDER BY` are fundamental concepts in SQL. Mastering them will significantly enhance your ability to write queries that accurately and efficiently manipulate data.
