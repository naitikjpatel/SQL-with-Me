**ðŸš€ Welcome to the SQL Mastery Series! In today's session, we explored advanced querying techniques, diving into the WHERE clause and mastering date-related queries.**

####* ðŸ“‘ Topics Covered:
    * WHERE Clause Mastery: Learn the art of filtering data with precision using the WHERE clause.
    * Single Row Comparison: Dive into single-row comparisons and enhance your ability to extract specific data.
    * Date Formatting: Uncover the secrets of formatting dates for better readability.
    * Querying on Date Separators: Navigate the complexities of date queries, including scenarios involving different separators.


**## Project Description**
Briefly outline the key features and functionalities related to WHERE clause, single row comparison, date formatting, and querying on date separators. 

*Example:*

This project delves into SQL SELECT queries, specifically exploring the WHERE clause, single row comparisons, date formatting, and querying based on date separators. It aims to provide practical examples and explanations to enhance your understanding of these essential SQL concepts.

**## Usage**

This section is the heart of your README, providing practical examples and explanations for each topic:

**### WHERE Clause**

* Explain the purpose and syntax of the WHERE clause.
* Provide code examples demonstrating its usage in filtering data based on specific conditions.
* Consider different operators (e.g., `=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`) and how they affect the query results.

*Example:*

The WHERE clause allows you to filter rows based on specific criteria. It's essential for selecting only relevant data from your tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
```

This query retrieves all rows from the `customers` table where the `city` column value is equal to 'New York'.

**### Single Row Comparison**

* Explain the concept of single row comparison in SQL.
* Illustrate how to compare values within the same row or across rows from multiple tables using comparison operators.
* Discuss common use cases for single row comparisons.

*Example:*

Single row comparison involves comparing a column value to another value within the same row or from different rows in one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > product_launch_date;
```

This query lists orders placed after the product launch date, filtering based on the `order_date` and `product_launch_date` columns.

**### Date Formatting**

* Explain how to format dates in SQL using specific functions or keywords.
* Provide examples of different date formatting options (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, custom formats).
* Discuss the importance of consistent date formatting for clarity and proper data analysis.

*Example:*

SQL provides various functions for formatting dates according to your desired output.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_date, TO_CHAR(order_date, 'DD/MM/YYYY') AS formatted_date
FROM orders;
```

This query selects the `customer_id`, `order_date`, and a new column named `formatted_date` using the `TO_CHAR` function to display the date in the DD/MM/YYYY format.

**### Querying on Date Separators**

* Explain how to query data based on different date separators (e.g., hyphen, slash, dot).
* Illustrate how to use regular expressions or string manipulation functions to handle varying date formats.
* Discuss best practices for dealing with inconsistent date formats in your data.

*Example:*

Querying on date separators requires handling different formats that may exist in your data. You can leverage regular expressions or string manipulation functions for flexibility.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE SUBSTR(birthdate, 5, 1) IN ('-', '/');
```

This query identifies users with birth dates containing either a hyphen or a forward slash as the separator between the month and day.
