## Multi-Row Comparison in SQL using ANY, SOME, ALL, IN, and NOT IN

This guide explores advanced techniques for comparing a single value with multiple values from subqueries in SQL. It delves into the functionalities of `ANY`, `SOME`, `ALL`, `IN`, and `NOT IN`, empowering you to write refined and expressive queries.

### Understanding the Operators

* **ANY**: Checks if **at least one** value in the subquery satisfies the comparison condition (similar to logical OR).
* **SOME**: Synonymous with `ANY` in most databases.
* **ALL**: Ensures **all** values in the subquery fulfill the comparison condition (like logical AND).
* **IN**: Compares a value against a list of values, returning `TRUE` if it matches any in the list.
* **NOT IN**: Opposite of `IN`, returning `TRUE` if the value doesn't match any in the list.

### Syntax

**Using ANY, SOME, and ALL:**

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS s
WHERE column_name(s) operator (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);

-- Replace operator with =, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=
```

**Using IN and NOT IN:**

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS s
WHERE column_name(s) operator (list of values);

-- Replace operator with =, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=
```

**Note:** Aliasing the table name with `AS s` is optional but improves readability in complex queries.

### Example

**Scenario:** We have a `Students` table with `student_id`, `name`, and `course_id`. We want to find students:

1. Enrolled in **any** of the courses with IDs `1`, `2`, and `3`.
2. **Not** enrolled in any of the courses with IDs `4` and `5`.

**Table: Students**

| student_id | name          | course_id |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1          | John Doe       | 1         |
| 2          | Jane Smith     | 4         |
| 3          | Alice Miller   | 2         |

**SQL Queries:**

**1. Using ANY:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students AS s
WHERE course_id ANY (SELECT course_id FROM Courses WHERE course_id IN (1, 2, 3));
```

**2. Using NOT IN:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students AS s
WHERE course_id NOT IN (4, 5);
```

**Results:**

| student_id | name          | course_id | (Query 1) | (Query 2) |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1          | John Doe       | 1         | TRUE       | TRUE       |
| 2          | Jane Smith     | 4         | FALSE      | TRUE       |
| 3          | Alice Miller   | 2         | TRUE       | TRUE       |

### Key Points

* `ANY`, `SOME`, and `ALL` allow comparisons with multiple values from subqueries, while `IN` and `NOT IN` operate directly on lists.
* Choose `ANY` or `SOME` when **one or more** values in the subquery need to match the condition.
* Use `ALL` when **all** values in the subquery must fulfill the condition.
* Employ `IN` to check if a value exists in a specific list, and `NOT IN` for the opposite.
* These operators provide versatile tools for crafting efficient and informative SQL queries.
