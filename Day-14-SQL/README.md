Certainly, I've updated the readme.md file to elaborate more on multi-row functions:

**SQL SELECT Syntax**

This document explains the basic building blocks of a SQL `SELECT` statement, along with execution flow. SQL is a structured query language used to manage data in relational databases. The `SELECT` statement is fundamental for retrieving data from tables.

**Basic Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY group_column_name
HAVING condition
ORDER BY order_column_name ASC|DESC
OFFSET offset_value ROWS
FETCH NEXT fetch_value ROWS ONLY;
```

**Clause Breakdown**

* **SELECT**: This clause specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the table. You can use asterisks (`*`) to select all columns.
* **FROM**: This clause specifies the table(s) from which you want to retrieve data. You can also include joins between multiple tables in this clause.
* **WHERE**: This clause filters the data based on a specific condition. Rows that do not meet the condition are excluded from the result set.
* **GROUP BY**: This clause groups rows based on shared values in one or more columns. It is often used with aggregate functions.
* **HAVING**: This clause filters groups of rows after the `GROUP BY` clause is applied. Similar to the `WHERE` clause, it filters based on a condition.
* **ORDER BY**: This clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns. You can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
* **OFFSET & FETCH**: These clauses are used for pagination, specifying a starting point and number of rows to retrieve from the result set. 

**Execution Flow**

1. **FROM & JOINs**: The database identifies the tables involved in the query and joins them according to the specified join conditions (if applicable).
2. **WHERE**: The rows that do not meet the `WHERE` clause condition are filtered out.
3. **GROUP BY**: The remaining rows are grouped based on the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause.
4. **HAVING**: Groups that do not meet the `HAVING` clause condition are filtered out.
5. **SELECT**: Expressions in the `SELECT` clause are evaluated to determine the final result set columns.
6. **DISTINCT (Optional)**: If `DISTINCT` is specified, duplicate rows are removed from the result set.
7. **ORDER BY**: The result set is sorted based on the columns and order specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.
8. **OFFSET & FETCH**: If `OFFSET` and `FETCH` are used, the specified number of rows are retrieved from the ordered result set, starting at the offset position.

**Multi-Row Functions**

Multi-row functions process data across multiple rows at once and are frequently used with the `GROUP BY` clause. Common examples include aggregate functions like:

* `SUM`: Calculates the total value of a numeric column for each group.
* `COUNT`: Counts the number of rows in each group (including duplicates).
* `AVG`: Calculates the average value of a numeric column for each group.
* `MIN`: Returns the minimum value of a column for each group.
* `MAX`: Returns the maximum value of a column for each group.

These functions provide summaries of the data within each group. You can also use window functions, another type of multi-row function, to perform calculations based on preceding or following rows within a result set ordered by a specific column.

**Example: Aggregate Function with GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS number_of_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY number_of_customers DESC;
```

This example retrieves the city and the number of customers from each city (using the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function) from the `customers` table. It groups the results by city, filters out cities with only one customer using the `HAVING` clause, and orders them by the number of customers in descending order.

I hope this explanation with the example clarifies the concepts behind SQL `SELECT` statements, their execution flow, and multi-row functions.
